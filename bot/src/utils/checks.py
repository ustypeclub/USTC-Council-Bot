"""Permission and role checking helpers for slash commands.

`discord.py` uses *check* predicates to guard commands.  This module defines
common checks used by the Votum bot.  They return callables that accept a
`discord.Interaction` and return a boolean.  When a check returns `False`, the
command will not run and a default error message is raised.
